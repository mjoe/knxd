knxd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/knxd/knxd.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/knxd/knxd)
====

KNX is a very common building automation protocol which runs on dedicated 9600-baud wire as well as IP multicast.
``knxd`` is an advanced router/gateway which runs on any Linux computer; it can talk to all known KNX interfaces.

This code is a fork of eibd 0.0.5 (from bcusdk)
https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/index.php/bcusdk

For a (german only) history and discussion why knxd emerged please also see: [eibd(war bcusdk) Fork -> knxd](http://knx-user-forum.de/forum/Ã¶ffentlicher-bereich/knx-eib-forum/39972-eibd-war-bcusdk-fork-knxd)

## New Features

* 0.10 (this branch)

  * Support for more than one KNX interface

  * Lots of bug fixes

  * ETS5 compatibility

* 0.11 (``conn_sep`` branch)

  * Major refactoring

  * dynamic KNX address allocation to local clients

  * local clients may talk to each other

## Building

On Debian:

    # Do not use "sudo" unless told to do so.
    # If "dpkg-buildpackage" complains about missing packages:
    # install them (with "apt-get install") and try again.
    # If it wants "x | y", try just x; install y if that doesn't work.
    # Also, if it complains about conflicting packages, remove them (duh).

    # first, install build tools and get the source code
    sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential
    git clone https://github.com/knxd/knxd.git

    # knxd requires libpthsem which unfortunately isn't part of Debian
    wget https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/pth/pthsem_2.0.8.tar.gz
    tar xzf pthsem_2.0.8.tar.gz
    cd pthsem-2.0.8
    dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i libpthsem*.deb

    # now build+install knxd itself
    cd knxd
    dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i knxd_*.deb knxd-tools_*.deb

### Daemon Configuration

Daemon configuration differs depending on whether you use systemd.
If "systemctl status" emits something reasonable, you are.

If you use systemd, the configuration file is ``/etc/knxd.conf``.
Socket activation is used for the default IP and Unix sockets
(port 4720 and /run/knx, respectively).

Without systemd, on Debian, edit ``/etc/default/knxd``.

The default Unix socket is ``/run/knx``.
Old eibd clients may still use ``/tmp/eib`` to talk to knxd.
You need to either change their configuration, or add "-u /tmp/eib"
to knxd's options.
(This is the default for "-u" before version 0.11. Don't depend on it.)

### Adding a TPUART USB interface

If you plug in a (properly programmed) TPUARTS into your computer, it'll show up as ``/dev/ttyACM0``.
This is a problem because (a) it's owned by root, thus knxd can't access it, and (b) if you ever add another serial interface that uses the same driver, knxd will use the wrong device.

Therefore, you do this:

* Run ``udevadm info --attribute-walk /sys/bus/usb/drivers/cdc_acm/*/tty/ttyACM0``.

  We're interested in the third block. It contains a line ``ATTRS{manufacturer}=="busware.de"``.
  Note the ``KERNELS=="something"`` line (your ``something`` will be different).

* Copy the following line to ``/etc/udev/rules.d/70-knxd.rules``:

  ```
  ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="204b", KERNELS="something", SYMLINK+="ttyKNX1", OWNER="knxd"
  ```

  Of course you need to replace the ``something`` with whatever ``udevadm`` displayed.
  An example file may be in ``/lib/udev/rules.d/``.

* Run ``udevadm test /sys/bus/usb/drivers/cdc_acm/*/tty/ttyACM0``.

* verify that ``/dev/ttyKNX1`` exists and belongs to "knxd":
  
  ``ls -lL /dev/ttyKNX1``

* add ``-b tpuarts:/dev/ttyKNX1`` to the options in ``/etc/knxd.conf``.

If you have a second TPUART, repeat with "ttyACM1" and "ttyKNX2".

You'll have to update your rule if you ever plug your TPUART into a different USB port.
This is intentional.
