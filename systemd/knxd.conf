# configuration for knxd.service
KNXD_OPTS="-u /tmp/eib -b ip:"

# The default options are "-u /tmp/eib -b ip:"
# which tell knxd to route between all of
#  /tmp/eib (legacy socket (-u))
#  /run/eib (socket activation via systemd)
#  TCP port 6720 (socket activation via systemd)
#  multicast client (-b ip:).

# If you have KNX hardware on a serial port or USB, add the appropriate
# "-b TYPE:â€¦" option. In this case, you probably want to set up a multicast
# server, not a client (i.e. use "-D -T -R -S", not "-b ip:").
# DO NOT use both.
# 
# If your KNX hardware is a KNX/IP gateway that doesn't do multicast,
# use "-b ipt:192.168.1.2" (or its DNS name) to talk to it.
#
# KNX MUST NOT have more than one path between any two devices. Thus,
# you need to make sure that the KNX/IP gateway does not route multicast
# before you use both "-S" and "-b ipt:".

# The default bus address of knxd is 0.0.1. If that's in use in your KNX
# network (or if you run more than one knxd on your network), set a
# different address (-e 15.0.99).


# Run `knxd --help` to get a complete list of available options and drivers.

## DO NOT use the following options:
## -i           -- /lib/systemd/system/knxd.socket does this for us
## -u /run/knx  -- likewise
## -d           -- /lib/systemd/system/knxd.service expects knxd to run in the foreground
